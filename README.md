## Building the boxes

_In order to build the boxes you need to have the `lxc-download`
template available on your machine. If you don't have one around please
create one based on [this](https://github.com/lxc/lxc/blob/master/templates/lxc-download.in)
and drop it on your lxc templates path (usually `/usr/share/lxc/templates`)._

```sh
git clone https://github.com/obnoxxx/vagrant-lxc-base-boxes.git
cd vagrant-lxc-base-boxes
make precise
```

By default no provisioning tools will be included but you can pick the ones
you want by providing some environmental variables. For example:

```sh
ANSIBLE=1 PUPPET=1 CHEF=1 SALT=1 BABUSHKA=1 \
make precise
```

Will build a Ubuntu Precise x86_64 box with latest Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Salt and
Babushka pre-installed.

When using ANSIBLE=1, an optional ANSIBLE_VERSION parameter may be passed that will specify which version of ansible to install. By default it will install the latest Ansible.

Additional packages to be installed can be specified with the ADDPACKAGES variable:

```sh
ADDPACKAGES="aptitude htop" \
make trusty
```

Will build a Ubuntu Trusty x86_64 box with aptitude and htop as additional
packages pre-installed. You can also specify the packages in a file
trusty_packages.

Note: ADDPACKAGES is currently only implemented for flavors of debian.
